####Others

1. Technology dishes, originally intended to use WPF to do all, but can not do the WPF embedded desktop can still be used normally, so form to do the background, and then the interface is really ugly

2. The status quo is half deserted, and there is no time to improve the work. It is expected to be a community, or you can upload the desktop directly, and you can synchronize the wallpaper on any computer, but there is no time for all kinds of reasons

3. Multi language, which supports multi language. There is a multi language design in database.db, and now we have done a Chinese English (machine translation) language switch

4. As for use, it can only be used normally without any desktop / desktop finishing (including but not limited to Tencent desktop finishing, 360 desktop and fences)

5. I don't know what else to write. I rely on love to generate electricity. It's totally boring to write. I will update it when I have time
